# Click-Thru Prototype

A Sketch plugin that creates a HTML click-through prototype of a website design so you can give your clients an idea what the website will look like. [Here's an example of a website](https://markhorgan.github.io/click-thru-prototype) generated by the plugin. Change the width of the browser to see the different responsive designs.

The commands will show up under `Plugins > Click-Thru Prototype`. To see it in action, open `demo.sketch` and then select `Plugins > Click-Thru Prototype > Export to HTML`.

## Usage

 You can create links between artboards, add external links, or show a JavaScript dialog. When you're finished adding these you can generate an HTML website, of the current page by selecting `Export to HTML`. The generated files can then be uploaded to a server so you can show your client.
 
### Responsive Design 
 
The plugin can handle responsive design, you just need to start your artboards with the same name e.g. `index`, `index tablet`, `index mobile`. When you change the width of your browser it will show a different artboard in the exported website. You can turn this feature off by unchecking `Responsive artboards` in Settings. You may need to update your artboard links after turning this setting on or off.

### Mobile Menu

On mobile you will want to show a mobile menu rather than the normal horizontal menu. To do this you need to select which layer is the button that shows the menu by selecting `Set Mobile Menu Button`, and which layer is the mobile menu by selecting `Set Mobile Menu`.
